  <h1>Don't let your eyes fool you.</h1>
  <p>I drift across the sky, a formless fluffernutter,
Made of a million tiny dreams, not a drop of butter.
I hold the whispers of forgotten lullabies,
And the forgotten squeaks of a thousand rubber duckies.

The wind tickles my belly, and I morph and churn,
A giant celestial churner, forever unburned.
I weep diamonds at times, on a schedule erratic,
Drenching unsuspecting picnickers with a glitter attack.

What am I?</p>
